# OCCP_Fillet
Simple project for searching for fillets

It's not a working project, but it contains methods LoadFile with aditional helping methods which loads model and checks for fillets using different methods.
Method uses models saved as .brep and won't work with others. It also need faces, so model which is just triangulation won't work.
